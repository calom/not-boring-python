"""
Validotr for chess board: 
A valid board will have exactly one black king and exactly one white king. 
Each player can only have at most 16 pieces, at most 8 pawns, and all pieces must be on a valid space from '1a' to '8h'; 
that is, a piece canâ€™t be on space '9z'. The piece names begin with either a 'w' or 'b' to represent white or black, 
followed by 'pawn', 'knight', 'bishop', 'rook', 'queen', or 'king'. 
This function should detect when a bug has resulted in an improper chess board.

Problems: 
- how to check that key is from 1a, 2b, ... 7h, 8h ? or 8x8 matrix 
    Got it, simple but should work
